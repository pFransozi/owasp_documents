SAMM is an open framework that provides an effective and measurable way to analyze and improve software security posture.

It is measurable, which means defined maturity levels across business practices
It is actionable, which means clear pathways for improving maturity levels
It is versatile, which means technology, process, and organization agnostic.
It is a highly usable and adaptable model. Do not forget, all models are wrong, some models are useful.

OWASP SAMM PRINCIPLES:

An organization's behavior changes slowly over time : Changes must be iterative while working toward long-term goals

There is no single recipe that works for all organizations : A solution must enable risk-based choices tailored to the organization

Guidance related to security activities must be prescriptive : A solution must provide enough details for non-security-people

Overall,it must be simple, well-defined,and measurable : OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM).

Adaptable Approach

Prepare -> Assess -> Set the target -> Define the Plan -> Implement-> Roll-out -> Prepare -> ...

SAMM 2.0 

Governance: strategy and metrics, policy and compliance, education and guidance;
Design: Treat assessment, security requirements, secure architecture; 
implementation: secure build, secure deployment, defect management;
verification: architecture assessment, requirements-driven testing, security testing;
operations: incident management, environment management, operational management;
